# RegressionModel - Car Price Prediction
I've used pyhton's scikitlearn libarary to predict Car Selling Price and Pandas, Matplotlib, Seabron to visualize and preprocess the data.<br>
I used regression models like LinearRegression,Lasso,Ridge,DecisionTreeRegressor,RandomForestRegressor and Compare them to get the best model then hypertuning the model to get the best result out of the given dataset.<br>
Please check the `notebook.ipynb` file to know better about the project.<br><br>
